Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

If you're creating a new component, that component must be snapshot tested and follow the general coding practices

## Creating a new component
New components must:
* have comprehensive tests
* have comprehensive documentation
* follow our code conventions
* be reviewed and approved

## Code Conventions
* Do not use semicolons ;
* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Prefer ' over "
* 120 character line length (except documentation)
* Readability over trickiness or performance
* Use the decorator pattern when applicable - ie @Radium
* Create stateless components when possible
* Create React `PureComponent`s if not stateless
* Create es6 classes inheriting from React's `Component` class if not pure or stateless
* Always include propTypes with as much specificity as possible - ie propTypes.shape is better than propTypes.object

### Tests
Tests are done using a few frameworks/libraries:
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - Snapshot tests + assertion library
* [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) - Spies for testing function calling
* [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) - Testing DOM interactions like clicking

Tests are co-located with their components in a `__tests__` directory and are named `ComponentName.spec.js`, per Jest convention.

### Test Conventions
* Reliable over comprehensive
* Simple over convoluted  
* Fast over slow

## Documentation

Documentation is generated by [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org) and can be augmented by a combination of JSDoc comments and by adding readme files for your components. Readme files for new components are required, and should be co-located with your component under a `docs` directory and be named `<YourComponent>.md`.
